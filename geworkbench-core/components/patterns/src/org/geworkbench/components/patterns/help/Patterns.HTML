 <h3>Patterns</h3> 
    <p>The Patterns component is located in the <b>View Area</b> in the top-right of the application. It is used to display resulting sequences found during a SPLASH pattern discovery discoverySession. This panel is necessary because the pattern discovery panel may not be able to display the discovered sequence in its entirety because of its length. Sequences are added to the Patterns panel by clicking on them in the &#8220;Patterns Discovery&#8221; panel.</p>
